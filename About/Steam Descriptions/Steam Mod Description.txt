This mod is made for 1 pourpuse, to merge "biotech"

Now, I know what you are thinking, how can you "merge" a single DLC? Well, I don't just mean the DLC. Biotech would include other forms of genetic manipulation, including (but not limited to) Super-Nanites (vanilla factions ancients),animal genetic engineering (vanilla genetics expanded), and more!
